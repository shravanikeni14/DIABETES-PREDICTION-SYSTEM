# DIABETES-PREDICTION-SYSTEM 🩺 

This project uses machine learning to predict whether a person is diabetic based on their medical attributes. The model is built using the Pima Indian Diabetes Dataset and trained using the Support Vector Machine (SVM) algorithm.

## 🔍 Features

- Predicts diabetic status (Yes/No) using health parameters
- Data preprocessing and feature scaling using `StandardScaler`
- Splits data using `train_test_split` with stratification
- Evaluates model accuracy on training and test data
- Real-time prediction functionality using custom user input
